      <p>
        A front-end developer is a software professional who specializes in
        creating the visual and interactive aspects of a website or web
        application, focusing on the user interface (UI) and user experience
        (UX) that users directly see and interact with; they primarily use
        technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the "front-end" of
        a site, ensuring a visually appealing and functional design for users,
        unlike back-end developers who work on server-side operations and
        database logic.
